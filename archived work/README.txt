The scripts and work contained in this folder represent previous attempts by our group to manually extract DOIs from (a) the IPCC reports themselves and (b) public databases of IPCC AR6 references. This attempts were made before complete .bib files were available for download from the IPCC; as those represent the most complete and up-to-date sources for citation data, these attempts have been abandoned.
