All .bib files explored were sourced from the IPCC website on Dec 14 2022 (WGI, WGII) and Jan 08 2022 (WG III).In WGIII Ch 1, 3, 17 there are no line breaks between the end "}" of one citation and the leading "@" of the next. I manually added these prior to further analysis. Futher, in WGIII Ch 4-16, there is a comment at the end of the .bib file which reads "@Comment{jabref-meta: databaseType:bibtex;}", which I also had to remove as it was throwing an error.
