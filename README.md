# IPCC_DOIs

This repository is for the Knowledge Justice Collective to pool code and data in our attempts to keyword search papers referenced in the IPCC's 6th assessment report on global climate change.

The data contianed here within is publically available from the IPCC's webiste.

This project is very much ongoing; scripts are by no means complete or guarenteed to run smoothly.
